## Contact ##
Name   : Harishwar Reddy Erri,
         02148304
Section: 202

Time to Complete: 6.5hrs

## Description ##
The main of the project is to develop a code using SFML to move the sprite one point to another point with the keys through the keyboard.

### Features ###
1.Decleared the Window with the size 800,750.
2.A Circle shape with the size 40.f and the color is rgb(201, 104, 104).
3.Mickey Mouse is the sprite which moves Left, Right, Up and Down on clicking the respective keys on Keyboard.
4.Fixed the setFramerateLimit to 60

### Issues ###
My major Issue is Delay in loading the Window, I guess this is because of my Audio feature that I have included in it.
could you please guide me in resolving this delay in loading the window

### Extra Feature ###
1.On clicking the left button the sprite flips to the left side then starts moving and clicking the right button it again flips to the right side, starts moving forward. 
2.Fixed the window dimensions so that the sprite can not move than the window borders.
2.Added the Audio feature to the window with .wav extension. Which starts playing the audio on clicking 'M' KEY and stops the audio on clicking 'S' KEY.
3.Added the Text feature to the window with the text "SFML" and Font Style with the .ttf extension. 
4.After changing the position of the sprite with the UP,DOWN,RIGHT,LEFT keys, On clicking the 'O'KEY again we can reset the position of the sprite to the beginning position.
5.Added the Background image to the Window with .png extension.

## Integrity ##
>> Forges or falsifies academic documents or records: <<
Falsifying academic documents and records is considered one of the major concerns in any academic setting, most importantly when it involves study and practice in the field of technology or programming. The implication of this rule is that the integrity of academic records provides evidence that a student possesses certain knowledge and skills. In the course of programming or computer architecture, assignments and other evaluation projects require students to do new code, understand complex algorithms, and solve real problems. This represents more than a loss of knowledge; the behavior of plagiarism deceptively changes one's academic record, thereby misinforming instructors and future employers about one's level of skill and abilities.
Both incidents are harming the student as well as the institution, either by forging the academic record or by misrepresenting someone else's work, or plagiarism of work. Programming assignments usually require a certain amount of creativity, problem-solving skills, and also deep conceptual understanding. Students who cheat on an assignment deprive themselves of developing these vital skills. This lack of real effort will only eventually hinder the progress of the individual and could lead to serious academic repercussions, such as failing grades or some other form of penalty. Therefore, honesty and integrity in academic writing are major founding ideas that help establish equity and effectiveness in any academic environment.
